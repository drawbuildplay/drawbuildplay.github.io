Spring is here, and before the days get too hot in Atlanta, I embarked on a project to build a privacy fence for our small backyard. Although tempted to DIY, the scale of the project made me opt for professional help. We needed 380 linear feet of fencing to enclose the backyard and connect to the sides of our home.

There were several reasons for building this fence:

1. With kids eager to play outside, a fence provides a safe area for them to enjoy without the worry of running onto the road.
2. Our area attracts a lot of deer. A fence would protect my planned garden from these visitors.
3. We aim to create an [outdoor living area](https://www.pinterest.com/drawbuildplay/outdoor-living/ "Outdoor Living Area"), and the fence is the foundational step in this plan.

### Backyard Privacy Fence Quotes for Small Yards

Finding the right builder for a privacy fence in a small backyard meant getting multiple quotes. I contacted 7 different fence builders. Prices varied significantly, influenced by the time of year and wood costs.

I noticed current prices were about 25% - 30% higher than what neighbors paid just 2 years ago. Quotes for 380 linear feet ranged from $9,000 to $12,000.

The last builder I contacted offered the best price at $7,900. With their proven track record in my neighborhood, I felt confident in my choice.

When sourcing quotes for your small backyard privacy fence, be mindful of any HOA or county permit requirements. Our fence had to be 6ft high, with 6x6 dado posts, and placed at least 18ft from the curb due to corner lot regulations.

### Backyard Privacy Fence Gates

Decide on the number of gates for your privacy fence. I added a gate near our garage and another on the opposite side for HVAC unit access and hose pulling. A wider gate was placed near the street, offering convenience for larger items and direct access to community amenities.

### Getting Privacy Fence Approval

After selecting your builder, they should provide a rough sketch of the fence. This is essential for HOA or local authority approvals. Ensure all regulations are met before starting construction.

### Privacy Fence Construction

Our fence construction was completed in two days. First, posts were mounted in cement. The second day involved aligning and nailing pickets, with final adjustments made for a perfect fit.

### Next Steps

Our next step is to stain the fence to match our deck (Sherwin Williams - Hawthorne). We'll start this in the fall
