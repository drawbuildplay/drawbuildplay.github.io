Many homes are still subscribed to cable.  Many are still paying for bundled services like Phone, Internet, and TV.  Often, these nasty cable bills are around $200 per month.

Now, what if I told you you didnt need to pay for phone or TV.  You can get internet service in most places for between $30 - $100 depending on how fast broadband speeds you want.  I currently pay AT&T for their Gigabit Fiber network $70/month.  My parents have comcast at 50 Megabit speeds for $50/month.  And thats it.  

* No fee for TV.  
* No fee for Phone.

This guide describes how we did this, and how to make free calls with {{<affiliatelink URL "https://amzn.to/2EmhzWX" Title "Obihai">}} and [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com).


PART 1: STOP PAYING FOR YOUR LANDLINE PHONE
-------------------------------------------

This one is easy.  Usually the cable companies charge around $10-$20 per month for the phone line.  Thats $120 - $240 per year you are throwing out the window.

This guide will show you how to use a regular phone in your home just as you have always done, but not have to pay a monthly fee for it.

1.  Sign up to [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com).  Its free and you get a modern Internet based calling account.
2.  Go to Amazon and buy an {{<affiliatelink URL "https://amzn.to/2EmhzWX" Title "OBI200 device">}} - its around $50 at the time of this post.
3.  Connect your {{<affiliatelink URL "https://amzn.to/2EmhzWX" Title "OBI200 device">}} to your router, and to your phone line.
4.  Create your [OBITalk account](https://www.obitalk.com)
5.  Add your new device to your OBITalk account, and link it to your [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) account.  The OBITalk setup wizard will take you through the steps.

If you want to maintain your existing phone number, you can also [transfer or port your number](https://support.google.com/voice/answer/1065667?hl=en) over to [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com).

You should now be up and running with a [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) based landline.  You can take advantage of all of Google Voice's features, such as Voice Mail, Call Forwarding, Call Recording, etc.
